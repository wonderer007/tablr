Hey <%= @recipient_name %>,

<p>Hope this email finds you well. My name is Haider Ali and I'm the founder of <a href="https://tablr.io" target="_blank">Tablr</a> - we help businesses like <%= @company_name %> turn customer reviews into actionable insights.</p>

<p>Here's the thing - most restaurants collect hundreds of reviews but never get actionable insights from them. We built Tablr to change that.</p>

<p>Our AI analyzes every review and surfaces the real issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slow dining experiences costing you customers</li>
  <li>Pricing complaints you didn't know about</li>
  <li>Service problems hurting your reputation</li>
  <li>Menu items that aren't performing</li>
  <li>Atmosphere feedback you can actually act on</li>
</ul>

<p>We have already helped restaurants increase their revenue by an average of 22% by identifying these hidden profit killers.</p>

<p>Would you be open to a quick 15-minute <a href="https://tablr.io/demo_requests/new" target="_blank">demo</a>? I'd love to show you how Tablr works with your actual reviews and give you a personalized analysis of <%= @company_name %>'s feedback.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you,</p>

<span>Best Regards</span><br/>
