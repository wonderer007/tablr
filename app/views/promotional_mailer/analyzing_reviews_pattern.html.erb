Hi <%= @recipient_name %>,

<p>You have customers who love <%= @company_name %>, but I noticed they keep mentioning some concern in their reviews - even the positive ones. </p>

<p>Most restaurants miss this because they focus on star ratings, not the actual feedback patterns.</p>

<p>I'm Haider from <a href="https://tablr.io" target="_blank">Tablr</a> - we built an AI tool that spots these hidden patterns. </p>

<p>You can request a <a href="https://tablr.io/demo_requests/new" target="_blank">free insights</a> for your <%= @company_name %>'s reviews.</p>

Best Regards
