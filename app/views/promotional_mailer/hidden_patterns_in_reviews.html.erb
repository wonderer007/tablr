Hi <%= @recipient_name %>,

<p>I noticed <%= @company_name %> has many recent reviews praising the food, but also a few that mention slow service and pricing concerns — things that often don't get surfaced for action.</p>

<p>I'm Haider from <a href="https://tablr.io" target="_blank">Tablr</a>, and we help restaurants like <%= @company_name %> turn all that feedback into insights you can act on — so diners leave happy and telling everyone about it.</p>

<p>Here's what Tablr offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spot recurring complaints (service, price, wait times) with prioritized fixes</li>
  <li>Drill into exact keywords—no vague summaries</li>
  <li>See which dishes, shifts, or locations drag scores</li>
</ul>

<p>You can request a <a href="https://tablr.io/demo_requests/new" target="_blank">free insights</a> for your <%= @company_name %>'s reviews.</p>

Best Regards<br/>
