<p>Hi <%= @recipient_name %>,</p>

<p>I recently analyzed <%= @reviews_count %> of the latest reviews for <%= @company_name %> and noticed a few trends that might be impacting your return rate.</p>

<p>While customers love the <%= @positive_theme_words.first&.downcase || "service" %>, there is a recurring theme around <strong><%= @top_complaint&.downcase || "wait times" %></strong> that keeps coming up.</p>

<p>We’ve compiled a full analysis of your positive and negative feedback trends here:</p>

<p><%= link_to "View Full Report for #{@company_name}", report_url(@place.place_actor_run_id), target: '_blank' %></p>

<p>At Tablr, we help restaurants turn these insights into revenue—our partners see an average 22% increase by addressing these hidden profit killers.</p>

<p>Would you be open to a 15-minute chat to walk through the report?</p>

<p>Best,</p>
