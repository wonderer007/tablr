<p>Hi <%= @recipient_name %>,</p>

<% if @ai_generated_intro.present? %>
  <% ai_lines = @ai_generated_intro.to_s.split(/(?<=[.!])/).map(&:strip).reject(&:blank?) %>
  <%= raw @ai_generated_intro %>
<% else %>
  <% if @business.rating.to_f >= 4.5 %>
    <p>I noticed <%= @company_name %> has an impressive <%= @business.rating %> rating—customers clearly love what you're doing. Keep building on that trust!</p>
  <% elsif @business.rating.to_f >= 4.0 %>
    <p>I noticed <%= @company_name %> has a solid <%= @business.rating %> rating—customers are responding positively. There's room to make it even better while continuing to build trust.</p>
  <% else %>
    <p>I took a look at <%= @company_name %>'s reviews and noticed some areas where customer feedback could use attention. At a <%= @business.rating %> rating, there's a real opportunity to turn things around.</p>
  <% end %>

  <p>However, customers complains about <%= @customer_complains.first(2).to_sentence(two_words_connector: ' and ', last_word_connector: ', and ') %> needs your attention, potentially impacting repeats.</p>
  <p>Additionally, customers suggestions for <%= @customer_suggestions.first(2).to_sentence(two_words_connector: ' and ', last_word_connector: ', and ') %> are a great opportunity to improve your business.</p>
